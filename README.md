OVERVIEW  OF THE PROJECT:
PROJECT: SIMPLE CALCULATOR
OBJECTIVE:
  The objective of building a simple calculator in Python is to implement basic arithmetic operations that can perform the following:
    Addition
    Subtraction
    Multiplication
    Division

The calculator should allow the user to choose which operation they want to perform, input two numbers, and then display the result. It should also handle errors like division by zero or invalid inputs.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
FUNCTIONS: Used to encapsulate the logic for each operation.
USER INPUT: To interact with the user and get numbers for calculations.
LOOPS: To allow continuous operation of the calculator until the user chooses to exit.
ERROR HANDLING: To deal with invalid inputs and prevent program crashes (e.g., division by zero).

Technologies Used:
PYTHON:Python is the primary programming language used for building the calculator.
TEXT-BASED USER INTERFACE (TUI):The calculator is built with a command-line interface (CLI),
which is a text-based interface where the user interacts with the program through text input and output.
